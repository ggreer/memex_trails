Do you remember how you discovered your favorite websites? Was it from a search result? A friend's tweet? A popular blog? A news site? Often, the mind forgets these things. Fortunately, Google Chrome does not. This extension lets you find out how you discovered a web page.

Inspired by [this blog post](http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2011/09/how_did_you_fin.php "How did you find my site?") and Vannevar Bush's 1946 essay, [As We may Think](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/3881/1/?single_page=true "As We May Think")

This extension becomes more useful over time. The more trails there are, the more likely one will come in handy.

What about links from IM clients, IRC, etc?  
Yeah it's hard to keep track of those with a browser extension. Unless Chrome adds a referring application to chrome.history, I'm not going to support it.
