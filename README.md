Arthur: The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake. 
Cobb: That's not true.

Do you remember how you discovered the websites you frequent? Was it from a search result? A friend's tweet? A popular blog? A news site? Often, the mind forgets these things. Fortunately, Google Chrome does not. This extension allows you to see the graph of how you discovered a web page. 

Inspired by http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2011/09/how_did_you_fin.php and http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/3881/1/?single_page=true

this extension becomes more useful over time. the more trails there are, the more likely one will come in handy

todo: build initial import tool that uses browser history to build trails

note: what about links from IM clients, IRC, etc? hard to keep track of those with a browser extension
